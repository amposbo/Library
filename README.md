# Library System
 Project originally created in Netbeans but can be run on any IDE.
 I have attached the image files that are used in the GUI, these should be imported into your IDE along with the java files for the GUI to function properly.
 This is a program that has a java back end and a swing front end GUI connected to a MySQL database to store the member and book information for the library.
